	- [ ] Export all SVGs
	- [ ] Export all SVGs to the randomizer repo (on Mac Pro)

- [ ] Video export
	- [ ] Make a video export button
	- [ ] Change a file name and resolution `00-00-01-spain-canary-islands-lotus-berthelotii-20220817-095839-4K-24H.mp4`

		- 1. 00:00:00â€“23:59:59 at 00:24:00, then speed up simulation *60
		- 2. Make variable named offset
	- [ ] Display clock
	- [ ] Move "sun"
- [ ] Sky
	- [ ] Skybox image
	- [ ] Lighting / Rendering
		- [ ] Change color
